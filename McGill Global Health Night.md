### Joanne Liu, International President of Medecins Sans Frontieres

*Talk to focus on personal life journey.*

- MSF: 35,000 workers in over 70 countries. - Front-liners, work in some of the toughest environments
    - 30% in crisis zones, 30% post-conflict, 30% stable areas
- Personal story
    - Always wanted to be in MSF. That's why she went to medical school!
    - Was inspired by "The Plague" by Camus.
    - Disagreed with decision - stood for her principles and quit. They later called her back because
      they decided she was right.
    - "This is war, and we are doing life-saving. We do not die from rape." - Decided this was not
      an acceptable answer. Helped sexual abuse survivors obtain ARVs, mental health care, abortion.
    - MSF won Nobel Peace Prize - used money towards Access Prize initiatives.
        - These initiatives reduced ARV price and helped with access to malaria treatments.
        - Required **awareness and political support**.
    - Another big MSF legacy: Plumpy'nut - nutritional food for children.
    - Ebola
        - Key challenge was to get community on board for safe burials etc.
        - Upsetting to see local centres not be able to keep up with the rate of deaths.
        - We are often triggered to do things only when our ***domestic interests are threatened***.
          It is important to get beyond this.
    - Key issue: antimicrobial resistance - huge global health issue. "Sepsis, the global silent killer."
- Lessons
    - Important to stand for your principles - important to know where to draw the line.
        - When you decide to leave, make sure that you ask yourself "Is this the right thing to do?",
          because sometimes when your principles prevent you from treating your patients, you have to
          wonder if you're doing the right thing
    - **Key message: We should not accept the unacceptable**
    - Be willing to challenge the status quo.
        - Speak up. It is in your hads to change things.
        - Go to the top, and tell them that they are failing. "We are all failing collectively" not
          just at the ground level.
    - Collect not only big data, but smart data.
    - A vote or a policy does not always change anything in the field. You must go to the field to
      see if a difference has actually been made.
        - Example: UN resolution to not allow bombing of functional hospitals. No immediate
          practical impact.
    - We need a better trigger for action - not just when the issue comes and knocks on your door.
        - I.e. migrant crisis. Ebola.
    - Medical care must remain at the heart of what we do. Not just **security at all costs**.
        - We should not do "a la carte" humanitarian aid. National imperative is important but
          cannot be the driver of response. The driver for action cannot only be fear.
          The driver of action can only be life. Fight for life.

### Panel Discussion

- Dr. Mario Raviglione: 
    - WHO constitution was a visionary statement. Especially the statement that health is
      a state of wellbeing, not simply the absence of disease.
        - "Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and
          not merely the absence of disease or infirmity"
- Dr. Keith Martin (Consortium of Universities for Global Health)
    - Spoke about lending power, voice, and agency to those who are voiceless and powerless
      to control their fate.
- Dr. Patricia Cavazzoni, Senior VP, Development Operations, Pfizer
