# Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH)

Rare disorder where cells called histiocytes enter various organs and cause damage. **Histiocytes** are a type of immune cell called a *macrophage*, which is present in the healthy connective tissue and normally helps to defend against infection. However, in LCH, these histiocytes instead begin to invade a person's own healthy organs. Other immune cells can also join in this invasion.

Organs affected can include:
- Skin
- Lymph nodes
- Lungs
- Thymus
- Liver
- Spleen
- Bone marrow
- Central nervous system

## Epidemiology

- Rare disorder. It is not known how common it is because there are too few cases and many cases are probably misdiagnosed.
  - Estimated incidence is 4 out of every 1 million children.
- **Genetics** are not well understood
  - *No evidence* that relatives of LCH patients are at increased risk of developing the disease.

## Disease Process

**The pathology of LCH is poorly understood.**

- Although LCH is named after Langerhans cells, research shows that LCH is actually most likely derived from dendritic cells, which are important immune cells.
- Some thought that viruses may cause LCH. However, evidence seems to show that this is not likely.
- There has been evidence that LCH is an autoimmune condition.
- There has been research into whether LCH is a neoplasm (cancerous tissue). LCH has many similarities to cancer tissue, but is a malignant condition.

## Clinical Features

In 55% of patients, LCH disease is limited to only one organ. In the other 45%, LCH affects multiple organs.

- The most commonly affected organ is bone (77% of patients)
- The next most common are skin (39%), lymph nodes (19%), liver (16%), spleen (13%), oral mucosa (13%), lung (10%), and brain/spinal cord (6%).

**Age plays a significant factor**. Younger children less than 3 years old are more likely to have acute multi-organ disease, while older children and adults are more likely to have chronic single organ disease.

### Symptoms

The most common symptoms in adults are
- **Skin rash**: Most commonly brown/purple spots all over the body.
- Shortness of breath
- **Excess thirst and urination**: Caused by a hormonal condition called diabetes insipidus, which causes the body to have difficulty regulating water levels.
- **Bone pain**: LCH can cause breakdown of specific parts of bone.
- Swelling of lymph nodes
- Weight loss
- Fever
- Sores in the mouth
- **Movement and memory problems**: Caused by involvement of the brain. Damage to brain can be investigated by MRI scan.

Disease affecting liver, spleen, lungs, brain, and spine are considered particularly riskly, and usually have a worse outcome.

### Diagnosis

LCH is diagnosed by biopsy, and analysis by a pathologist. 

## Treatment

Please note that everything below is for treatment of **children**. There is very little known about how best to treat adults. The best approach for adults is to enroll in a clinical trial. For those who cannot or wish not to enroll in a trial, the next best approach is **cytarabine** (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> over 30 minutes in 30 mL NS, daily for 5 days, repeat monthly for 12 months) for patients with multiple bone or any other lesions (except patients with only skin lesions). If this is an adult case you are interested in, please let me know and I will provide more information, as a few other drugs are available depending on the disease type.

Before treatment a doctor should study the following:
- Pathology of the disease by biopsy
- Many blood and urine tests to investigate the functions of all the organs which could be affected.
- Bone marrow biopsy in any patient where the liver and/or spleen is affected.
- Genetic testing. 65% of LCH patients have a specific mutation (called *BRAF V600E*). This can help to confirm the diagnosis.
- X-rays of the bones, skull, and chest. Also recommended is a PET scan to locate all the places in the body affected by the disease.
  - CT scans can also be performed to study bones and other organs in more detail
  - MRI scans should be performed in patients with diabetes insipidus, or any symptoms that suggest that the brain may be affected.
  - Ultrasound, CT, or MRI for patients with liver or spleen enlargement.
- Lung tests for patients with lung symptoms
- Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy for patients with evidence of decreased blood protein or poor nutrition.

### Determining Risk Category

Patients are classified as either high risk or low risk based on their clinical features and diagnostic tests. High risk patients are usually those with multi-organ disease, and especially those with disease in certain "Risk" organs such as the liver, spleen, lungs, and brain. The risk category of the patient should guide the treatment of the disease.

#### Treatments for Single Organ LCH

Single organ disease is typically less critical and easier to treat. However, all patients with single organ disease might progress to multi-organ disease. So every patient must be carefully monitored and frequently tested.

- Patients with disease in bones far from the brain are low risk. When bony regions with disease are surgically removed using a technique called **curettage**, which involves cutting away the involved portion of bone, they are very unlikely to experience a return of their disease. Only 4-10% of these patients see a return of their disease after treatment with curettage.
- Patients with disease in bones **near the brain** are high risk. More intensive therapy is required.
  - Typically, patients are treated with a combination of the drugs **vinblastine** (an anti-cancer drug) and **prednisone** (a hormonal anti-inflammatory drug).
- Patients with disease in the spine or leg bones are at risk for bone breakage/collapse with risk for serious injury. These patients require **stabilization of the bone** and may benefit from **radiation therapy**.
- Patients with disease that has spread to a single lymph node can have that lymph node removed. If disease has spread to 2 or more nodes, or also involves other organs, then patients should also be treated with **12 months of chemotherapy**.
- Disease that has spread to lungs is most common in adult smokers. These patients should immediately attempt to quit smoking. The treatment of this type of disease is different and detailed. If you want more information about this, please let me know and I will find it for you.
- Patients with disease that only affects the skin should be observed closely. Many patients with skin-only disease will recover on their own, without therapy. However, many will progress to multi-organ disease. Therefore, these patients are usually treated with **oral methotrexate** (an anti-cancer drug) and, if needed, **6-mercaptopurine** (a drug that calms the immune system). These drugs should be given carefully to prevent significant loss of blood cells, which is a common side effect.

#### Multi-organ disease

LCH is so rare that there is not much known about how best to treat multi-system LCH. The best thing for most patients is to **enroll in a clinical trial**, in order to receive the most attentive care and access to cutting-edge therapies.

Patients who cannot or choose not to take part in clinical trial should undergo 6-week intensive chemotherapy with **vinblastine and prednisone**. If, after 6 weeks, patients are responding well to therapy should continue chemotherapy for up to 12 months. **Mercaptopurine** can be added for patients who have risk-organ involvement (liver, spleen, lungs, brain).

If you are interested, I can provide a **lot** of information about clinical studies which have researched the effectiveness of these medications.

Typical therapy doses are:
- Prednisolone (40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> per day orally for four weeks, and then tapered over two weeks)
- Vinblastine (6 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly intravenous bolus for six weeks)

Note that 6 mg/m<sup>2</sup> means 6 mg of drug multiplied by the patient's body surface area in metres<sup>2</sup>. The Body Surface Area is calculated by the following formula:

BSA = 0.007184 &#215; Weight<sup>0.425</sup> &#215; Height<sup>0.725</sup>.

This is the **typical algorithm for deciding on next treatment in multi-organ disease**:
