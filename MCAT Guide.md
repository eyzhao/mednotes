# Before the exam

- Don't wear too warm clothes. Dress light and pack layers. The room may not be climate controlled, and the headset they give you might make you feel too warm.
- Arrive Early
- Read through your AAMC test date instructions and/or confirmation letter or email
- Pack snacks and drinks for break times.
- Take it easy the evening before


# The Exam Centre

## The room

- Three room I was in was small and poorly ventilated. It also had a moderately loud humming noise in the background.
- The screens were old and low resolution. The mice & keyboards were gross-looking.
- There will be a locker or cubby for your stuff.
- You will be assigned a test station. Go to it and follow the instructions on the screen.
- You must sign out each time you leave the room, and sign in each time you go back.

## Noise

- They give you both earplugs and a headphone looking thing to go over your ears. That way, the two layers together keep out sound pretty well. But can be a bit distracting.


## Use of Breaks

- There was enough time for me to have snacks during the breaks.
- Use the bathroom during every test break even if you don't think you need to
- I packed a couple of sandwiches for lunch. Don't pack anything that could potentially cause a mess or require a microwave.
- I've heard that some people like to go for a little jog during the breaks to keep their energy up. If that's not for you, just make sure you get out and stretch to try to relax a bit.
- Don't fixate out think about the previous section's questions
- Get back to your seat with 2-3 min to spare at least. This is to make sure that you aren't panicked, which could cost you time.
- Do what you need to to relax. I took the test with a friend so we could talk a bit (I don't think we were allowed to talk about the exam though).
- I don't think you'll be allowed drinks in the exam room, but you can have them during break times.

# Mindset

- You've done enough. You've studied hard enough. The MCAT is a marathon, not a sprint. Don't feel like you need to cram that last bit of information right up to the moment of the exam. You need to be relaxed enough to be adaptable and think on your feet.
- It's stressful and anything can happen on the day of. It will always be challenging and feel stressful, so expect that. The exam will probably feel harder than practice tests, even if it isn't, just because you are more aware of what you are unsure of.
- And most of all, you need to be alert but not tense. Let yourself be relaxed enough to get in the zone, but not so relaxed that you doze off.

# Good Luck! You'll do great :)
