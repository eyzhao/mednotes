# Main Facts

## Nasal Turbinates

- Childhood story / When you get a cold
- This is something that everyone experiences, but few know about
  - **Everyone** experiences this at some point in their lifetime
  - Persistent problems occur in about 50% of population
- Anatomy:
  - Bony structure, covered in mucosal tissue which changes in size & shape based on blood flow
  - &uarr; blood flow &rarr; nasal congestion. Multiple factors:
    - Changes in pressure & orientation. When lying on your right side, your right nostril may become blocked. Standing up helps clear both sides.
      - **Why??** Some have hypothesized that this is part of what triggers you to turn over in your sleep, as an adaptation to prevent bulk airflow in your lungs from becoming stale. This helps keep air moving between your two lungs and prevents bacteria and viruses from causing a lung-infection, known as pneumonia.
    - Worsens with cold or allergies - both sides can become swollen, making it difficult to breathe.
    - Parasympathetic nervous system stimulation, usually drug-related
  - Very important roles in immunity, smell, and ensuring proper airflow

## Women are Patchy

- Calico cats: cats which have many patches of color in their fur.
- To understand this, we need to understand a bit about genetics
  - Our body is made of cells
  - Every cell has a copy of our genome, which is the complete genetic code made of DNA.
    - The genome is like a book, providing instructions for how your cells work
    - Actually, our genome is like 46 books, because we have 46 chromosomes.
    - These chromosomes come in pairs, we get 23 from mom, 23 from dad
    - One of these chromosome pairs determines our biological sex. They are called X and Y.
    - Women have two X chromosomes. Men have an X and a Y chromosome.
  - X-inactivation
    - However, this doesn't mean that both X chromosomes are active in women.
    - In each cell, one of the two X chromosomes is inactivated and silenced. So the cell only reads from the remaining active X chromosome book, ignoring most of the inactive one.
    - In cats, the color gene is on the X chromosome. This gene is like a chapter in the X chromosome book, a chapter with instructions on what color fur to grow.
    - Calico cats have different patches of color where different X chromosomes are inactivated. Humans are the same way, except that we just can't actually see the X-inactivation as color differences.
  - How are color patches determined?
    - Cells are tiny. So why do calico cats have such big patches?
    - When a cell divides X-inactivation is passed along
    - The reason the patches are big is that X-inactivation status is decided and made permanent pretty early in development as an embryo
    - This means all the cells with the same color actually come from the same cell of origin in the embryo
    - And it's not just skin deep - all of your internal organs also have patches with different X chromosomes active
  - But **how** does this actually happen?
    - Through something called epigenetics. We don't have time to get into it, but epigenetics involves factors that affect your DNA structure without actually changing your DNA sequence.
    - Going back to the book analogy, it's like going and putting in bookmarks to decide which chapters you're going to read and which ones you won't. But you don't actually change what's written on the page itself.
    - Epigenetics is fascinating, and has huge implications for understanding and treating disease.

## REM Sleep Muscle Paralysis

- Many have heard about the different phases of sleep
  - As we fall asleep, we start in very light sleep, progress to deeper sleep, and then eventually enter REM sleep
  - REM sleep stands for Rapid Eye Movement sleep, because during this phase the eyes tend to dart around rapidly
  - Strangely, however, all other muscles in the body appear to become paralyzed and immobile
  - This is an important phase of sleep with many neurological and hormonal processes which many believe are centrally responsible to the key function of sleep
  - It's also the phase of sleep where we have dreams.
- As early as 1959, the French scientist Michel Jouvet has been studying this phenomenon. And I say has been studying because he is still alive today. He's retired but still does research on sleep.
- Recent research from U of T demonstrated that sleep paralysis methods may be mediated by two chemical mechanisms: Glycine and GABA<sub>A</sub>
  - Glycine and GABA<sub>A</sub> are two well-known inhibitory neurotransmitters. Glycine's role has been well understood for a while now, but GABA<sub>A</sub> has just entered the mix.
  - Caveats: Research was done on rats - may not translate to humans
  - Also, there is definitely much more to learn, and we certainly don't have a complete understanding of this process.

## Hair

### Myth: Cutting your hair causes it to grow faster
- Hair goes through three phases of growth, which vary depending on the individual and on the body region
  - In the first phase, it grows actively. On the scalp, this phase lasts on average about 1000 days, but only about a month for your eyebrows. This is why your head hair grows far faster than your eyebrows.
  - In the second phase, hair growth stops and pauses for a few days. The hair starts to break away from the follicle.
  - In the third phase, the hair completely breaks from the follicle. Eventually, the first phase starts again and may push the previous hair out, if it hasn't fallen out already.
- On your head, about 90% of your hairs are in the first phase of active growth
  - On your eyebrow, less than 10% are.
- In addition to the growth cycle, the rate of hair lengthening is also different from place to place.
  - Shaving or trimming your hair has no effect on the rate of hair growth.

### Male Pattern Baldness

- We've all seen classic male pattern baldness
  - Thinning of hair on the crown.
  - Hair often remains on the rim and back of the head
- Different parts of the scalp derive from different embryological origins - some are inherently more sensitive and reliant upon testosterone levels
  - When testosterone levels decrease with age, these hairs become lost. The ones which remain come from follicles derived from a different part of the developing embryo.
- One surgical treatment for male pattern baldness is to remove these testosterone-insensitive hairs and their follicles, and implant them over the balding area.

## Where does the weight go?

- In our culture, it can seem like everyone is trying to lose weight
- Where does the weight actually go when you lose it?
  - Also, why do we weigh less in the morning than at night?
- What people often think
  - You lose weight defacation
    - Your body only eliminates what it could not digest or absorb from your food.
    - What you poo out is unlikely to weigh any more than you what eat, so if this is the only way of losing weight, you would always be gaining more weight from your food than you would lose from your poo.
  - You sweat it out
    - Sweat is made up primarily of water and salts.
    - Both are heavily regulated by the body, and neither is the loss of fat which we usually associate with weight loss.
    - You do NOT sweat fat.
- What is your body made of?
  - Five major elements: CHONS
  - These elements form long molecular chains, which give us the key nutrients
    - Sugars, fats, proteins, and nucleic acids
  - Your body *burns* sugars and fats through a process called cellular respiration
    - This happens through a series of biochemical reactions which converts the carbon chain of sugars & fats into carbon dioxide
    - CO<sub>2</sub> is breathed out
- Where does the weight go?
  - When you sleep, some of your lost weight is through lost water vapour, which you replenish when you take a drink. But any sugar and fats burned in your sleep will be lost as carbon dioxide.
  - When you exercise, you burn sugar & fat faster. This is why you have to breathe faster and harder when you exercise.
  - How to lose weight? Do any activity that gets your heart rate up and gets you breathing hard. Do it often.

## The Incretin Effect

- Mechanism of insulin:
  - Blood sugar rises &rarr; insulin released by pancreas &rarr; insulin triggers cells to absorb sugar from the blood and store it
- A strange experimental finding
  - Researchers injected glucose intravenously &rarr; Caused an increase in insulin as expected
  - But when you eat the same amount of glucose &rarr; Much faster and larger rise in insulin
- Something about the process of eating triggers more insulin release
  - Discovery of hormones GLP-1 and GIP, which are called the Incretin hormones.
  - They allow your gut to talk to your pancreas, and prime it to release more insulin
- Promise for drug development
  - Many diabetics have an insensitivity to glucose. Their bodies don't release enough insulin to respond to glucose levels.
  - If you can inject an incretin into your blood, it will help your body to release more insulin
  - Problem: Incretin hormones are rapidly broken down in the bloodstream
  - Solutions:
    - Use a chemically modified incretin hormone which does the job, but takes longer to break down
    - Use a drug which inhibits the thing that breaks down the incretin.
  - Both have been attempted and have resulted in diabetes drugs on the market.
